## Problem Statement

You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your
profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

<strong>Example 2:</strong>

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

<strong>Constraints:</strong>

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10`<sup>5</sup>
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10`<sup>4</sup>

## Assumptions

1. Stock prices will always be non-negative.
